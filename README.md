What's Cooking?
An app by Yamini Kumawat and Matt Thorry

Purpose:
The purpose of this app is to help people find recipes that meet their specific wants and needs. In the mood to make Chinese but only have onions on hand? Our app can help you find the *perfect* recipe.

Directions:
1. Users first input a specific preference they have. This preference can be based on allergies (Gluten or Peanut Free), meal time (breakfast, lunch, dinner) or even special occasion (birthday, Christmas).
2. After inputting their preference, users are prompted to enter an ingredient they would like to use. With our database of over 1000 recipes and 10,000 ingredients, users are likely able to find what they want!
3. If a user has no preference for food or ingredients, they can type "Random" and will receive five unique recipes from the database.
4. If a user inputs something that is not in the database, they will be prompted to enter a different preference or ingredient.

Bon App√©tit!
